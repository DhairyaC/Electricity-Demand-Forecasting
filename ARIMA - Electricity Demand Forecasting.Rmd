## y(t) = [β0 + β1·x(t−1) + α1·y(t−1) + α2·y(t−2) + w(t) + θ1·w(t−1) + θ2·w(t−2)]
## two inputs : x0 = 1 and x(t-1)
## ARIMAX side 5/7
## G = [1, 0]
## AR(2) and MA(2)
## C is a 3x1 matrix [1, 0, 0]
## F = [1, 0, 0]

## check the eigen values of F using alpha1 and alpha2

## if the eigenvalue is less than 1, it is stable
## if the eigenvalue is complex, it is stable with oscillations
## if the eigenvalue is greater than 1, it is unstable

## the above model is not stable mostly

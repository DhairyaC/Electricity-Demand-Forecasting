## Objective
In this project, we want to measure how daily temperatures affect electricity demand for a region. We will also investigate how accurately temperature can be used to forecast the demand in mid-term (8 weeks/2 months).

## Models
1. Linear Difference Equation
2. Auto Regressive Moving Average Model (ARMA/ARMAX)

## Conclusion
We were able to infer that daily temperatures works well in estimating the electricity demand over time. Since our data was for one year, we were restricted by number of predictors which could be taken into consideration. If data is available for more time points, it would be interesting to see how the other factors like humidity and holidays affect the demand.
